Hi Tamás Nepusz, I would like you to Co-Found Audiowiki with me!

Your Interactive Map inspired me a lot! It can be the next Great way to listen to music!

Let's create 

The Greatest map Code Ever Written!

I'm creating simply, the fastest website to listen to samples in the world.

I've schematized the layiout plan that will clearly revolucionize the music industry with

it's fast paced navigation and hover n play tecniques.

(______on a ps note: My next step is to make a kind of Audio Forager (see 1 -www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_FnVMnuerc less noisy cuz there would be machine learning and mods on every map, the noisiest samples could take a litle more time to load, etc), but the data is

augmented on "giant seeded shrubberies", Imagine that! A normal Park suddently becomes the

healthiest DISCO of the world!
_________________________)

it will be also the largest sample wiki of this planet.

with the fastest and simple audiocutter incorporated for people to chop songs and tracks

to their respective samples and templates without an hassle.

the main navigation would be trough Music maps with many dots (see 2 - my prototype, it will be like this but many more dots on a cute organized map exandro.com/prys/sampler/), with a flexible

vector image on the background, coded to accomodate more samples and still look pretty and

for the presentation to be changed according to the search filters

- how recent are the sounds

- how many views they have

- the favorited by your similars

-by artist/by gender

- and then a very interesting 
thing that is new on the web that is the emotional portrait of the songs, according to the

visual and audio data recieved by the reaction of the user to each sample, adding his

emotion to the overal painting of the sample's emotional portrait, which could be seen in

the ball

it has many interesting features but the most important are:

- click s to save sound - Click D on your favorite folder to download all the sounds

- hover n play on each sound, hover again back to the dot to play the music

- there is gamification going on, people gain points by uploading, reacting, tagging

samples , etc.

- you can scroll on the dot to be teleported to a different musical map with the same

sample included!

- There's a radio world map, an accents map, an elemental sound map, moaning map, everymap

you can think of !

- there are voice commands so you gain octupus superpowers, even while minimized

and many more!

I have ways of monetizing the website without being a duche , cuz it's gonna be huge,(see 3 app.wisemapping.com/c/maps/666500/public)

what do you say? are you interested in the idea? Come and Co-found Audiowiki with me!

I'm looking for the best  SlashTypers (programmers) who are also into music so we

can colab to Make the Greatest Musical code ever Written!!
